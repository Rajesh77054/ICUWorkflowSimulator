create an Interactive Workflow Dynamics Model. The proper concept for this tool is based on "Systems Dynamics Modeling" or "Workflow Simulation Modeling." These approaches allow for real-time input of variables and output of projected impacts on workflow efficiency.

Key Features of the Input/Output Tool
Input Variables
The tool should allow users to input and update key factors that influence ICU workflow, such as:

Interruptions
Nursing questions (per hour)
Exam callbacks (per hour)
Peer interruptions (per hour)
Admissions/Transfers
New admissions (per shift)
Floor consults (per shift)
Transfer center calls (per shift)
Critical Events
Frequency of unstable patients (per week)
Time consumption per event (hours)
Provider Availability
Number of providers (e.g., 2 in the closed model vs. 5 in the hybrid model)
Time allocated to specific tasks (e.g., charting, rounds, exams).
Output Metrics
The tool should calculate and display the impact of the input variables on key workflow outcomes, such as:

Total interruptions per provider
Time lost to interruptions
Time available for focus tasks (e.g., charting, exams)
Delays in routine tasks (e.g., charting, patient updates)
Provider workload and cognitive load
Risk of workflow bottlenecks
Projected provider burnout risk.
Dynamic Visualization

Use graphs, charts, or heatmaps to visualize the impact of changes in variables.
For example:
A bar graph showing the increase in interruptions per provider when moving from a hybrid to a closed model.
A pie chart showing time allocation across tasks.
A line graph showing delays in charting as interruptions increase.
Scenario Modeling

Allow users to simulate different scenarios, such as:
Adding an extra provider to the closed model.
Reducing the frequency of interruptions.
Increasing the ICU capacity or patient census.
The tool should output the projected impact of these changes on workflow efficiency.
Suggested Framework for the Tool
This tool can be built using the following frameworks or concepts:

Queueing Theory

Models the flow of tasks and interruptions as queues, analyzing how workload is distributed and where bottlenecks occur.
Time-Motion Analysis

Tracks time spent on various tasks and interruptions, providing insights into time lost to inefficiencies.
Agent-Based Simulation

Simulates the behavior of individual providers (agents) under different scenarios, showing how changes in workload or interruptions affect overall efficiency.
Systems Dynamics Modeling

Models the ICU as a system with interconnected variables, showing how changes in one factor (e.g., interruptions) affect others (e.g., charting delays, provider fatigue).
